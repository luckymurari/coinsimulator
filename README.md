# coinsimulator
Simulates buying crypto-currencies over time.

Using historical data from CoinMarketCap, it runs a strategy against each week of data, buying coins.
At the end of the run, it tells you the value of your holdings.

**Requires Node.js.**

## Default Strategy
Buys the top 50 coins, by market cap, spending a total of $100 each week.  To change the number of coins or the amount spend, 
edit `strategies/top50.js` or create your own strategy and call it via the `-s` option below.
